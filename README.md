# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, Python files, SQL and Tableau.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out [lafirm.github.io](http://lafirm.github.io)

#### The Tableau portfolio is located [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lafir).


## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks
1. Run notebooks locally on your machine by using Jupyter Notebook Server, [click here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html) for more details.
2. To easily run our notebooks without any installations on our local machine, we can use cloud services like Binder, Google Colab, Kaggle etc., [click here](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/) for more details.
